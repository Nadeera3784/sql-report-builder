The project is a comprehensive reporting system designed to facilitate seamless generation, customization, and scheduling of reports for users. It leverages a React frontend interface, enabling users to dynamically construct custom reports using an intuitive builder tool. These reports can then be downloaded in CSV format, providing users with convenient access to their data.

Additionally, the system offers a scheduling feature, allowing users to automate the generation and delivery of reports via email at specified times. This feature enhances user convenience by ensuring timely access to critical information without manual intervention.

Behind the scenes, the backend of the system is powered by ExpressJS, providing robust API endpoints for handling user requests and interacting with the MongoDB database. MongoDB serves as the database solution, offering flexibility and scalability for managing report data efficiently.

Furthermore, the system includes an analytics page within the frontend interface, enabling users to gain insights into their data through visualizations and statistical analysis. This analytics feature enhances the overall utility of the platform by empowering users to derive meaningful insights from their reports.

In summary, the reporting system offers a comprehensive suite of features, including report customization, scheduling, email delivery, and analytics, all seamlessly integrated into a user-friendly interface for enhanced usability and productivity.
